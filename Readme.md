Collects prompt engineering practices with Claude LLM.

One approach is to automate prompt refinement iterations programmatically.

![Prompt_Optimization.ipynp](./Prompt_Optimization.ipynb) walks tough an example. 
There are many moving parts in a prompt. 
A suitable framework needs to decompose the all parts of prompt (system, assistant, output requirements, few samples, etc.)
so that an algorithmic search algorithm could be developed. 

Another approach is to state prompt refinement as an optimization problem 
hence one can put **prompt refinement** in an optimization framework to search for an optimal prompt.
Evolutionary algorithm approach is applicable for emulating iterative evolution of prompt population to find a set of high performing prompts. 
Clear definition of prompt representation will help to define mutation and cross-over operations. 
One approach is we can utilize LLM to mutate a prompt or cross-over two prompts to obtain new offspring prompts. 
Then, EA applies selection to build the next generation of prompts.
